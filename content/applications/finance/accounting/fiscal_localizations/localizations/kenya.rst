Kenyan TIMS integration
=======================

The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has decided to go digital for tax collection through the **Tax
Invoice Management System (TIMS)**. As of December 1st, 2022, all VAT-registered persons should
comply with TIMS. The goal is to reduce VAT fraud, increase tax revenue, and increase VAT compliance
through standardization, validation, and transmission of invoices to KRA on a real-time or near
real-time basis.

All VAT-registered taxpayers should use a **compliant tax register**. Odoo decided to develop the
integration of the **Tremol G03 Control Unit (type C)**, which can be run locally through USB. This
device validates invoices to ensure financial documents meet the new regulations and send the
validated tax invoices directly to KRA.

Sending the data to KRA using the Tremol G03 Control Unit
---------------------------------------------------------

As a pre-requisite, check out that the
:ref:`Kenyan Accounting modules <localization/kenya/configuration>` are installed on your database.
Then, go to the :menuselection:`General Settings --> Kenya TIMS Integration section` and check that
the :guilabel:`control Unit Proxy Address` has been automatically filled out, confirming the
connection is established between the device and your computer.

Upon confirmation of a new invoice, the :guilabel:`Send invoice to device` button appears. Clicking
on it sends the invoice details to the device and from the device to the government. The
:guilabel:`CU Invoice Number` field is now completed in your invoice, confirming the information has
been sent.

The :guilabel:`Tremol G03 Control Unit` tab contains fields that are automatically completed once
the invoice has been sent to the government:

- :guilabel:`CU QR Code`: Url from the KRA portal which reflects a QR code.
- :guilabel:`CU Serial Number`: reflects the serial number of the device.
- :guilabel:`CU Signing Date and Time`: The date and time when the invoice has been sent to KRA.

If you click on :guilabel:`Send & Print` a .pdf of the invoice is generated. The
:guilabel:`Kenyan Control Unit Info` are mentioned on the document.

.. note::
   To verify KRA has received the invoice information, take the :guilabel:`CU Invoice Number` and
   and enter it in the :guilabel:`Invoice Number Checker` section on
   `Kenya Revenue Authority website <https://itax.kra.go.ke/KRA-Portal>`_. Click
   :guilabel:`Validate` and find the invoice details.
